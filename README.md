# Scheduler Service
A NestJS API to manage schedule and tasks.

## Running the service using docker-compose
The easiest way to get this service up and running is by using docker and docker-compose.

### Requirements
- Docker (4.21.1)
- Docker Compose (2.19.1)

### Step-by-step
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scheduler-service.git
    cd scheduler-service
    ```

2. **Run the services using docker-compose:**

    The following command will instatiate a postgres database and setup the migrations and connections
    for running the api using docker and docker-compose. Make sure the ports 5432 and 3000 are available on your host machine.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d  # Daemon mode
    ```
    **Note:** You may need to run it twice in case the API service starts before the database service is up and ready.


3. **Access the API documentation at http://localhost:3000/api**

    Once the servers are up and running, you may access the swagger documentation of the project at http://localhost:3000/api


## Running the service locally
### Requirements
- Node (tested on 20.13.1)
### Step-by-step
1. **Clone the repository and navigate to its folder:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scheduler-service.git
    cd scheduler-service
    ```
2. **Make sure to have a postgres up and running locally.**
    
    You can easily setup a postgres in a docker container using the following command:
    ```
    docker run --name scheduler-service-db -p<port>:<port> -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -e POSTGRES_DATABASE=<database> -d postgres
    ```
3. **Setup an .env file on the root folder with the following:**
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:<port>/<database>?schema=public"
    ```
4. **Install project dependencies**
    ```
    npm install .
    ```
5. **Run prisma migrations and start the application**
    ```
    npx prisma migrate dev
    npm start
    ```
6. **Access the API documentation at http://localhost:3000/api**

    With the project up and running, you may access the swagger documentation of the project at http://localhost:3000/api

7. **(Optional) You might want to run tests using the following:**
    ```
    npm run test
    ```

# Footnotes
1. I decided not to update the start_time and end_time of schedules within a task update, as this was not specified in the requirements and to keep the project simple. Depending on the requirements I would dispatch an event whenever a task is created or updated, allowing the schedule controller/service to handle it.

2. I did not add createdAt and updatedAt timestamps to the entities since this was not specified in the requirements.

3. In a team setting I would clarify the duration of a task (is it in seconds?). This would also be necessary to update the schedule timestamps.

4. In a production environment, I would not expose the database settings in the docker-compose file. This is for "educational" purposes only. :D (contains humor)
